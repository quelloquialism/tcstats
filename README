TCStats, random stats about competitors in TopCoder's Algorithm contests.
Originally written in VB.Net by jmzero.

Environment:
Debian 6.0.7, 2.6.32-5-amd64 (probably works on other flavors as well, possibly
  with config tweaks)
Python 2.6.6 (probably works on most 2.6.x/2.7.x versions)

Python modules:
Flask 0.10.1 (with Jinja 2.7 and Werkzeug 0.9.1)
Requests 1.2.3

To run:
- install python 2.6/2.7
- install pip
- use pip to install flask and requests
- run "python etl.py" in the src directory to download feeds and create db
- run "python tcstats.py" in the src directory to launch app
This should start up the flask app on http://localhost:5000/.
